Source code for https://comedowncomic.com, a webcomic commissioned for me by Sola Simpson 
~~Written with React/Gatsby, with Prismic as a CMS and Netlify to serve/host the site.~~
Initially written with vanilla JS and Gatsby, but converted to Typescript and Next-JS -- partly because I've come to prefer both, and partly to see how such a conversion would be done
