Source code for https://comedowncomic.com, a webcomic commissioned for me by Sola Simpson.

Initially written with React/Vanilla JS/Gatsby, but converted to Typescript and Next.js -- partly because I've come to prefer both, and partly to see how such a conversion would be done. Prismic as CMS and Netlify for hosting.
